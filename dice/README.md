## What is Dice

Typically refers to small, often cube-shaped objects marked with different numbers or symbols on each face. They are commonly used in various games and gambling activities for generating random numbers.

Each face of a standard six-sided die is typically marked with a different number from 1 to 6. When rolled, the result is determined by the number that appears on the face that lands facing up. The outcome of rolling a die is random, assuming it is fair and unbiased.
